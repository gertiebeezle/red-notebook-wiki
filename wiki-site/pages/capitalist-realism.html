                <h2>What is Capitalist Realism?</h2>
                
                <blockquote>
                    "It is easier to imagine the end of the world than capitalism"
                </blockquote>

                <p>Capitalist Realism is like a <strong>pervasive atmosphere</strong>, conditioning not only the production of culture but also as a regulation of work and education, acting as a kind of invisible barrier constraining thought and action.</p>

                <p>From Mark Fisher's analysis (noted April 9): CR can only be threatened if it is shown to be inconsistent or untenable.</p>

                <h3>Key Characteristics</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Paralysis of imagination</strong>: Inability to conceive of alternatives to capitalism</li>
                    <li><strong>Reality principle</strong>: Ideological constructs presented as "empirical" facts</li>
                    <li><strong>Atmosphere/Vibe</strong>: Present in all of life, creating paralysis to action and hope</li>
                    <li><strong>Inevitability</strong>: Poverty, war, famine, and injustice presented as inevitable</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Mark Fisher's Framework</h2>

                <p>Capitalist Realism emerged in the 1980s during the Reagan-Thatcher era. This was when Capitalist Realism was "fought for and established."</p>

                <blockquote>
                    "Capitalism has colonized the dreaming life of the population"
                </blockquote>

                <h3>Historical Context</h3>
                <p>The "End of History" narrative following the fall of the Soviet Union was accepted subconsciously. There isn't a need for anything else, we already have it. This left America "infantile and obese — tacky, violent, scared."</p>

                <p>Capitalism caught stride around the same time as the <strong>demystification of the world</strong> — God is dead! What is left is <code>being-as-consumer-spectator</code>.</p>

                <h3>Business Ontology</h3>
                <p>Everything exists as a business does. This creates a fundamental shift in how we understand reality itself.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="areas-attack" class="entry-card">
                <h2>Three Areas of Attack</h2>

                <p>CR can only be threatened if shown to be inconsistent or untenable in these domains:</p>

                <div class="concept-grid">
                    <div class="concept-card">
                        <h3>1. Environmental Catastrophe</h3>
                        <p>Capitalism is going to exterminate us. The climate crisis reveals the fundamental unsustainability of infinite growth on a finite planet.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="concept-card">
                        <h3>2. Mental Health</h3>
                        <p>The psychosocial costs of capitalism manifest in epidemic levels of depression, anxiety, and suicide. "Depression costs the world 1 trillion in productivity" — what a sad quote.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="concept-card">
                        <h3>3. Bureaucracy</h3>
                        <p>Late Stage Capitalism repeats Stalinism in valuing symbols of achievement over actual achievement. "Triumphs of publicity!"</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Privatizing issues brought by Late Stage Capitalism neuters collective response. Individual "solutions" to systemic problems.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="wall-e" class="entry-card">
                <h2>Wall-E and Inter-passivity</h2>

                <blockquote>
                    "Wall-E performs our anti-capitalism for us, allowing us to continue to consume with impunity"
                </blockquote>

                <p><strong>Robert Pfaller's concept of Inter-passivity:</strong> By watching (and enjoying—it is a good film) such an obvious example of the negative/bad/future consequence of capitalism, we participate and interact with the subjugation.</p>

                <p>The film performs our anticapitalism for us. This <em>releases guilt</em> and suppresses what we have seen and know, allowing us to, in clear conscience, continue infinite consumption.</p>

                <p>The most gothic, wretched depiction of Capital is its most accurate representation. Capital is both:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hyper abstract and impersonal structure</li>
                    <li>Nothing without our cooperation</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How Anticapitalism is Used by Capital</h3>
                <p>This desensitizes and paralyzes us. The spectacle creates exhaustion and empathy fatigue.</p>

            <section id="mental-health" class="entry-card">
                <h2>Mental Health Under Capitalist Realism</h2>

                <h3>Reflexive Impotence</h3>
                <p>The youth have <strong>depressive hedonia</strong>. There isn't an inability to get pleasure (anhedonia) but an inability to do anything other than to pursue pleasure.</p>

                <h3>Motivation/Demotivation Binary</h3>
                <blockquote>
                    "It's up to them to discover what they're being made to serve"
                </blockquote>

                <p>How to get out of the motivation/demotivation binary, so dis-identification with the control program registers something other than apathy?</p>

                <h3>The "Mismatch"</h3>
                <p>In the education system: Market logic vs. the confining concentration logics of disciplinary systems vs. Post-literate youth too wired to concentrate.</p>

                <p><strong>None of this is normal at all!</strong></p>

                <h3>Suicide Data</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>2nd or 3rd leading cause of death for 10-34 age group</li>
                    <li>Number of people who killed themselves in the United States from 2000-2022 increased by <strong>35%</strong></li>
                    <li>4x higher in men than women</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Capitalism and Mental Illness</h3>
                <p>The way capital is a BWO creates a space where human ill will/neurosis/psychosis is formed → Late Stage Capitalism/ Capitalist Realism</p>

                <p>Mental illness as a Body Without Organs? Can a BWO consume itself? Are empathy and empaths redistributed by capitalism in the form of neurodivergence?</p>

                <h2>Related Concepts & Connections</h2>

                <h3>Lacan's Real</h3>
                <p>For Lacan, the Real (desire) is what any "reality" suppresses. Reality constitutes itself through this repression.</p>

                <p>The Real is an unrepresentable "X," a traumatic void that can only be glimpsed in the fractures and inconsistencies in the field of "apparent reality."</p>

                <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Invoking the Real to show the reality Capitalism presents through:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Environmental Catastrophe</li>
                    <li>Mental Health</li>
                    <li>Bureaucracy</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Experiencing the Real through threshold crossings. Violations. Must be visceral, not condescending.</p>

                <h3>Connections to Other Theorists</h3>

                <h3>Contemporary Applications</h3>
                <p>How does Trump's economic policy align to late stage capitalism? How does this differ from Capitalist Realism?</p>

                <p>Moral critiques are silly, we all know it exists. The challenge is showing CR to be <em>inconsistent or untenable</em>.</p>
