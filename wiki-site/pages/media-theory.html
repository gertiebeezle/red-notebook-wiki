                <h2>McLuhan: The Medium is the Message</h2>

                <blockquote>
                    "Money, like writing, has the power to specialize and re-channel human energies into separate functions"
                </blockquote>

                <h3>Technologies as Extensions</h3>
                <p>All technologies are extensions of our physical and nervous system to increase speed and power.</p>

                <h3>The Clock</h3>
                <p>West discovered you can fix time as something that happens between two points. From this came our Western feeling of time as duration → unknown feeling to non-literate societies.</p>

                <p>Just as work began with a division of labor, duration begins with the division of time → Clocks</p>

                <p><strong>The clock can be paralytic</strong>. Time stops flow state. Perception of time stops flow state.</p>

                <h3>Hopi Time</h3>
                <p>Hopi Indians do not perceive time as uniform succession or duration. Many kinds of time exist, aligned to natural phenomena.</p>

                <p><strong>Time vibration. Nothing is really linear.</strong></p>

                <h3>Conservative Media Use</h3>
                <p>Conservatives, rooted in Goldwater, has harnessed the Medium. Conservative cognitive framework makes the mindset/those who receive the message particularly suited to Mass media.</p>

                <p>Islamic Radicalism / Al-Qaeda / ISIS use of new media.</p>
